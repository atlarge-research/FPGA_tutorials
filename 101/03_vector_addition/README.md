The goals of this example:
- show the differences between Vitis HLS and Vitis flow
- discuss how programming using Vitis for on-device execution
- discuss how interfacing host and FPGA
- discuss on how using external memory (device DRAM), and how to optimize for its use (TBD)


This example is based on the Vitis Accel "Hello World" example.
